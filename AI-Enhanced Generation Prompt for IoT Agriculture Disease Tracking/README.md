# IoT-Enhanced Crop Disease Mutation Tracking System

A comprehensive distributed IoT network for real-time crop disease monitoring, mutation tracking, and AI-powered analysis.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **IoT Sensor Network**
   - Leaf imaging cameras with disease detection
   - Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture)
   - GPS-enabled geo-tagging
   - Real-time data transmission via MQTT/HTTP

2. **Real-Time Graph Visualization**
   - Spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCN)
   - Graph attention mechanisms for disease progression tracking
   - Interactive dashboards with live updates
   - Historical graph snapshots and analysis

3. **Cloud Storage Infrastructure**
   - AWS S3/Azure Blob Storage for scalable data persistence
   - Segmented storage for raw data, processed graphs, and AI models
   - Secure data access and audit trails

4. **AI-Powered Analysis**
   - Deep learning models (ResNet, CNN, ST-GCN)
   - Attention-based feature selection
   - Pattern deviation detection and mutation tracking
   - Continuous learning from new data

5. **Alert System**
   - Real-time notifications for disease mutations
   - Precision alerts with intervention recommendations
   - Mobile/web dashboard integration

## Performance Targets

- **Detection Latency**: < 5 minutes from ingestion to dashboard update
- **Classification Accuracy**: > 90% for disease mutation detection
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple growing seasons of data
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with fault tolerance

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **IoT**: MQTT, HTTP, WebSocket
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Graph Neural Networks
- **Cloud**: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage
- **Frontend**: React, D3.js, WebGL
- **Database**: TimescaleDB, Neo4j for graph data
